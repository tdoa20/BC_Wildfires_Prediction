# BC Wildfire Predictive Model

## Background and Overview
In recent decades, wildfires have caused widespread environmental damage, economic loss, and displacement of communities across many regions, including British Columbia. To prevent and mitigate the impacts of wildfires, many valuable studies have been conducted in the past.The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that estimates wildfire risk using historical data. By analyzing patterns in past wildfires, weather conditions, and other environmental factors, the model aims to identify areas at higher risk.
