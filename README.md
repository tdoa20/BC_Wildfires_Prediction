# BC Wildfires Prediction
The goal of the project is to create a preliminary model to predict wildfire risk that can be further expanded and improved by other researchers. Such a model can 
help mitigate wildfire risk in the future. Authorities can potentially use these predictive models to readjust their spending to avoid property loss and damage from the fires, plan resources in advance, and locate equipment appropriately to respond quickly.
